### Week 2

**Fibonacci Series**
* Find a fibonacci number at position n
* Find the last digit of a fibonacci number at position n

**Greatest Common Divisor**
* Find the GCD of two numbers using [Euclidean Algorighm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

**Least Common Multiple**
* Find the LCM of two numbers using [Euclidean Algorighm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

**Improved Fibonacci Series**
* Find the fibonacci number at position n using [Binet's Formula](http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/hostedfibFormula.html#section1). The solution is incomplete because it gives incorrect result for large numbers even after using BigDecimal and BigInteger classes. It's due to terminated decimal numbers using Binet's formula.
